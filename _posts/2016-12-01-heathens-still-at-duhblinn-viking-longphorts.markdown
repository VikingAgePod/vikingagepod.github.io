## The Heathens still at Duhblinn: Of Viking Longphorts

In this episode we explore the construction, function and purpose of the Viking Longphorts which were established in Eastern Ireland in 841 CE. 

These sites, Linn Duachaill in County Louth and Duhblinn, give us a fascinating view into the lives of early Vikingar in Ireland and allow us to see how their role changed after the establishment of permanent bases. 

Along the way we will see Irish Kings go to war with swords and bishops staffs and witness the importance of Horses to Viking warfare.
