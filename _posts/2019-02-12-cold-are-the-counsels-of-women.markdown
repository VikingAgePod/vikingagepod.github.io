## Mother of Kings III - Cold are the Counsels of Women

In this episode, we continue our exploration Gunnhild _konungamóðir_'s life and legend, discussing the power of her words and the speech of powerful women throughout Old Norse Literature.

Whether goading their male relatives to violence, advocating peace and accommodation, or predicting what fate held in store, women in the Sagas are frequently pictured exercising power though their words. Today, we are going to take a deep dive into these portrayals. Along the way we will meet all manner of powerful women and get a chance to marvel at their powerful words.
