## The Eastern Way I

In this episode we begin our exploration of the Baltic Sea region by examining two very different sources of evidence which point to early Viking activities in the Eastern Baltic. First we discuss a dramatic tale which has come down to us from the pen of everyone's favorite Icelandic author, Snorri Sturluson. This story centers around a certain Yngvarr, King of the Svear, and traces his dramatic demise at the hands of the Eistr.

We then step out of the world of literature and into the dirt to explore a remarkable archeological find which was recently uncovered on the Estonian island of Saaremaa. We talk monumental graves, ancient ships, informative skeletons and even discuss how we really are what we eat.

I hope you enjoy.
