Denmark at the Dawn of the Viking Age - Viking Worlds II

In this episode we take a birds-eye view of the natural and human landscape of Denmark at the Dawn of the Viking Age. 

We'll talk about geography, settlement and set the stage for our future discussions about all the gritty details of life in the Viking Age.
