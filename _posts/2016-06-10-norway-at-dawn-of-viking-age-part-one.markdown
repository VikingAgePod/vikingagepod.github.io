## The North Way at the Dawn of the Viking Age (Part One)

Hello, my name is Lee and this is Episode #8 - The North Way at the Dawn of the Viking Age (Part One)!

In this episode we explore the history of landscape and peoples of Western Norway at the Dawn of the Viking Age. We will follow the coast of Norway on a  journey with a Norwegian Chieftain, and discuss slaves, tenant farmers and petty Kings.

Along the way we will determine whether or not overpopulation and lack of arable land were the determining factors behind the initial Viking Raids in the early 800s CE.

For all that and more - you can listen below!
