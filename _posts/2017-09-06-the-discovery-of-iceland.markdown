## The Discovery of Iceland

	
In this episode we will be exploring the initial discovery of Iceland by Norse Sailors in the mid-800s. 
First - we set the stage by discussing the literary and historical legacy of Iceland and discussing why it is so important to understand the culture of the island before using the amazing works which were written there in the 1200s. 

We then follow the stories told in the Landnámabók and the Íslendingabók about the discovery and initial settlement of Iceland - including storms, sworn brothers and path-finding ravens.  

Finally - we conclude with a discussion of high-seat pillars and the close ties which the initial Icelandic settlers maintained with the societies and cultures from which they had emigrated.
