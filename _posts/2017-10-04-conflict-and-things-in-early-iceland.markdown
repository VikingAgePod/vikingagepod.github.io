## Conflict and Things in Early Iceland 

	
In this week's episode we explore the growing number of challenges faced by the Icelanders as the landnám period drew to a close in the 930s. We will then take a long look at the key components of the institution the Icelanders turned to in order to solve that problem - the thing. 

Along the way we will talk about beheadings over fish, witness a chieftain get given a bloody nose by a silver-wielding farmer  and we will even examine the ever dodgy - if very helpful - writings of Cornelius Tacitus.

### Recommended Reading 

This week's recommended reading is [Debating the _Thing_ in the North](https://www.academia.edu/33192134/THE_FULL_VOLUME_1_The_Assembly_Project_TAP_._A._Sanmark_F._Iversen_N._Mehler_S._Semple_Eds._2013._Debating_the_Thing_in_the_North._Journal_of_the_North_Atlantic._Special_Volume_5._Pp_124) - a collection of papers edited by Alexandra Sanmark, Frode Iversen, Natascha Mehler and Sarah Semple. Covering a wide range of topics, including the origins of the thing, its religious and cultural significance and even its spacial organization, this is a must read for those interested in the legal and political history of Scandinavia. And even better - it’s available for free online.
