## Taking Land in Iceland

	
In this week’s episode we explore the initial settlement of Iceland. We’ll talk about who settled the island, when they settled down and begin our discussion of the society they created. 

To kick us off we are going to explore this topic by example by exploring the settlement led by Unn the Deepminded - one of the most remarkable figures from the Viking Age.

### Recommended Reading 

Recommended reading for this week is _The Saga of the People of Laxardal_. This is one of my favorite sagas and will be a major source of examples throughout this series. I like the translation by Keneva Kunz in the [_Sagas of the Icelanders_](https://www.amazon.com/Sagas-Icelanders-Penguin-Classics-Deluxe/dp/0141000031/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=&sr=) put out by Penguin Classics.
