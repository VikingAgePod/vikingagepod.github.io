## Creating the Icelanders

In this episode - the second of two parts - we explore the continued Christianization of Iceland in the 1100s with a particular focus on the development of literate culture and the implications of this new culture on Icelandic Society. Today, we explore how the written laws, language and history of this period worked to create the idea of the Icelanders as a distinct and unique people. 

I do hope you enjoy.
