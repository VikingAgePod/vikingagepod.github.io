## The Conversion of the Icelanders

In this episode we dive headfirst into an event still which profoundly colors and shapes our understanding of the Norse world today. That's right - it's time to discuss the Conversion of the Icelanders which took place at the Althing of 999 or 1000CE.

I do hope you enjoy.
