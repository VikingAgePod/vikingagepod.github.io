## The Iron Age

Hello, my name is Lee and this is Episode #6 - The Iron Age!

In this episode we are going to do a lightning-tour through the Scandinavian Iron Age - beginning around 500 BCE and ending around 800 CE with the first Viking Raids. This period, spanning over 1000 years, is chocked full of political, technological, economic and cultural change in the North.

The goal of this episode is to provide a baseline understanding of the period which directly preceded the Viking Age, not for the test, but rather to give you a framework to work from when I start blabbering on about the Iron Age in later episodes.

For all this and more, checkout the episode below, or subscribe on iTunes. Happy listening :)
