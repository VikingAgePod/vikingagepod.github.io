## The Martyrdom of Blathmac

In this episode we are going to return to the roots of Vikingar activity by following a series of Viking raids on Irish monasteries which were conducted in the early 820s. This will lead us nicely to the main focus of todayâ€™s episode - the Martyrdom of the Irish Aristocrat turned Monk Blathmac.

Along the way we will encounter saintly bones gilded in gold, possible monkish hunger strikes and the several trickily pronounced words. I hope you enjoy.

For all that and more - you can listen below!
