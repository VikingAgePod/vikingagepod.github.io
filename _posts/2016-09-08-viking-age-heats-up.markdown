## The Viking Age Heats Up
This episode is packed full of Irish Viking Age goodness as we track the escalation of Viking activity in Ireland from 807 - 813.

Along the way we explore what the Irish were up to while the Vikingar were busy raiding in the Scottish Hebrides, the first raids on the West Coast and a series of bloody skirmishes between Vikingar crews and Irish warbands.

For all that and more - you can listen below!
