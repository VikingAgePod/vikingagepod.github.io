## Mother of Kings V - I Lay This Curse on You

In this episode, we return to the life and legend of Gunnhild _konungamóðir_, exploring her time in exile in Denmark and her son's eventual return to power in Norway. We then turn our attention to the broader topic of women, power and magic in the Sagas.

Along the way we discuss goat-illusions, magical yarn and cat-skin gloves as we explore several fantastic tales of magically-inclined Saga women.
