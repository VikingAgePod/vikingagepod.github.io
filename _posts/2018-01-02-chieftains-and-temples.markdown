## Chieftains and Temples

In this episode we begin to explore Pagan practice in Iceland, focusing on the religious roles of the _goðar_. In this first episode we will be discussing: 

- The role played by the _goðar_ in the conversion of Iceland. 
- A rune stone attesting to an early Danish _goðar_. 
- A remarkable cult building at Uppkåra in South Western Sweden. 
- The close ties between political and religious power in Viking Age Scandinavia. 

I hope you enjoy.
