## Poetry and Remembrance

In this episode, we explore poets and poetry in the Norse world, focusing particularly on the role they played in preserving history, myth and legend. 

Along the way we see what happens when you eat a fish's head, unlock the meaning of confounding Skaldic verses and hear what Snorri Sturluson had to say about poets and their role in preserving history. 

I do hope you enjoy.
