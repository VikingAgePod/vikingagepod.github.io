## Charlemagne and the Saxon Wars Pt 2 - Carolingian Viking Age V

In this episode we conclude our discussion about the reign of Charlemagne and his 30 year-long war against the Saxons. 

This time, we dive into the meat of the Saxon wars, talking about the various campaigns, rebellions and mass executions which marked this brutal conflict. 

Then, we turn our attention to how Charlemagne and the Franks ruled Saxony once it was conquered, with particular attention paid to how central religion was to the Carolingian ideology of rule. In many ways the Kingdom of the Franks resembled a theocracy, and we explore this in depth in this episode.
