## From Foragers to Farmers

Hello, my name is Lee and this is Episode #3 - From Foragers to Farmers!

In this episode we explore the transition from Hunting and Gathering to Agriculture in Scandinavia. Along the way we encounter conflicting hypotheses, meager evidence and a story about Status and Reputation.

The Agricultural revolution has been called the most important invention in Human history, so it feels only fair that we spend an episode exploring the potential causes in Scandinavia.

For all this and more, checkout the episode below, or subscribe on iTunes. Happy listening :)
