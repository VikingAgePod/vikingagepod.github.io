## Mother of Kings I - The Threshold

In this episode, we set off on a new mini-series exploring the life and legend of Gunnhild _konungamóðir_ - Mother of Kings - and other powerful women in Old Norse Literature.

This first installment doesn't touch too much on Gunnhild herself, but instead sets up some background information. Specifically, today we focus on the way gender is described and depicted in Sagas and Law codes, exploring some fascinating prose and poetry along the way.

I hope you enjoy.
