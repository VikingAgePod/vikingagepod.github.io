## The Story of Harald Finehair, Part 1

In this first episode of Viking Stories, we begin our discussion about King Harald Finehair - the first King of Noway. We will trace the earliest years of King Harald Finehair's reign and along the way we meet his mother, father and see how the Saga authors of the 1200s attempted to gussy up Harald's lineage. 

Finally, we will witness King Harald's pledge to conquer Norway - or die trying.
