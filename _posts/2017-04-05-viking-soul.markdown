The Viking Soul - Viking Worlds IV

In this episode we get deep into the weeds and examine some intriguing clues as to what Pagan Scandinavians may have though about the soul. 

We talk about decorated helmets, battles with bears and women who are taller than the mountains. Along the way we will hopefully get a little closer to understanding the nature of the Viking worldview.

This episode is a little different, but I hope you enjoy!
