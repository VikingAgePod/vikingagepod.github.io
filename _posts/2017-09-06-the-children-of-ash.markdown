## The Children of Ash

	
We are back! This is simply a quick update episode to catch everyone back up to speed and set the stage for our next series of episodes. 

Those episodes are going to cover the Discovery, Settlement and Development of Iceland. This will all serve as part of our quest to understand why the Sagas, Myths and Legends of Pagan Scandinavia were recorded there in the 1200s.
