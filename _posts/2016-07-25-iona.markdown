## Iona

In this episode we see the Vikingar shift their focus north, from Ireland to to the Inner Hebrides and a target which, from the perspective of the Vikingar, must have been almost too good to be true. We are speaking of course about the great monastery of Iona.

We'll explore the raids in 795 CE and 802 CE - and then the details and psychological and material impact of the brutal Viking Raid of 806 CE. Along the way we will also meet St. Columba and his journey from bad-boy churchman to missionary saint. It should be fun, why don't you give it a listen?

As promised in the episode, here is a helpful map to help you keep things straight!
