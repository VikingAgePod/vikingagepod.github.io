## Snorri Sturluson, Big Farmers & the End of the Icelandic Free State

In this episode we conclude our series on Iceland by discussing the rapid changes which shook the Icelandic political system in the 1200s. 

We discuss the likely causes of these changes, explore the life and times of our good friend Snorri Sturluson and examine the impact that this time period may have had for our own understanding of Icelandic history. 

I do hope you enjoy.
