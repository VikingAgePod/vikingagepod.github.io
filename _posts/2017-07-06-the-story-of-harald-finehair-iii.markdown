## The Story of Harald Finehair, Part 3

	
In this episode we conclude the story of Harald Finehair and we take a look at what life looked in Harald's Norway was like. 

Along the way we encounter more berserkar, polygamy and lots and lots of chieftain's fleeing Norway for the greener pastures of Iceland.
