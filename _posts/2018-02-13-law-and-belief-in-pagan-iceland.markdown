## Law and Belief in Pagan Iceland

In this episode we conclude our discussion on Pagan practice in Iceland by exploring the close connections between the law and pagan beliefs. Along the way we talk about oath rings, the assemblies of the gods and a rather nasty conflict revolving around excrement. 

I do hope you enjoy.

### Recommended Reading 

Our recommended reading for this week is [Viking Law and Order]( https://edinburghuniversitypress.com/book-viking-law-and-order.html) by Alexandra Sanmark. In this readable and beautifully illustrated book, Professor Sanmark reviews the latest archeological evidence for _þing_-sites throughout Scandinavia. This book highlights the similarities and differences of these sites and provides an excellent guide to these important locations. You should pick it up.
