## Bringing Thor to Iceland

In this episode we continue our exploration of Pagan Practice in Iceland by taking a look at religious roles and responsibilities held by some of the first Icelandic settlers and how these roles translated to their new home.  We will be discussing: 

- The political and relgious ideology which prominent Icelandic settlers brought with them from Norway. 
- What the _Landnámabók_ has to tell us about early Icelandic settlers and their temples. 
- The importance and meaning of high-seat pillars. 
- A remarkable cult site found at Ranheim in Norway.  

I hope you enjoy.

### Recommended Reading 

Our recommended reading for this episode is the excellent [The Viking Diaspora](https://www.amazon.com/Viking-Diaspora-Medieval-World/dp/1138020796/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1505314295&sr=1-1&keywords=The+Viking+Diaspora) by Judith Jesch. This has been one of my major sources for the entire Children of Ash series and now seems like a good time to introduce it. An essential resource for information about the Icelandic Free State and the ongoing connections between the Norse colonies throughout the North Atlantic.
