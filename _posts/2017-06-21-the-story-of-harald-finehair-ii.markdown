## The Story of Harald Finehair, Part 2

In this episode we trace King Harald Finehair's rise to power as he conquers his way up the Eastern Edge of Norway and then back down the West Coast. Along that way the young, shaggy king will kill, negotiate and bully his way into the history books. 

Plus - this being the Viking Age Podcast - we also discuss some myths around the berserkir and Harald's administrative innovations! 

For those who want to learn more about the Berserkar - check out this excellent [MA Thesis by Roderick Dale](http://eprints.nottingham.ac.uk/28819/).
