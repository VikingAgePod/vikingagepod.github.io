## Charlemagne and the Saxon Wars - Carolingian Viking Age IV

In this episode we talk about the reign of Charlemagne and his three decade long war against the Saxons. 

We'll talk about the early years of Charlemagne's rule - and explore just why he decided to go to war against the Saxons. Along the way we talk about the pre-Christian life in Saxony and why conversion was such an important goal for the King of the Franks.
