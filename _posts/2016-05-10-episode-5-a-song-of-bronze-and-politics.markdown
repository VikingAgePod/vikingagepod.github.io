## A Song of Bronze and Politics

Hello, my name is Lee and this is Episode #5 - A Song of Bronze and Politics!

In this episode we are going to explore the Game of Chiefdoms in the Nordic Bronze Age. Specifically look at the growing social and economic stratification which is defining of this age. We will look at how such inequality in wealth and power can develop, how such power can be maintained once achieved and the consequences of this growing inequality on society at large.
