## Welcome to the Viking Age!

Hello, my name is Lee and I am thrilled to welcome you to the Viking Age Podcast!

The purpose of this project is simple, to share the history of the Viking Age with the world. By history of the
Viking Age, I mean the real history, not what is cooked up by the History Channel.

The story of the Viking Age is one of a collision of cultures. It is the story of what happened when Pagan Scandinavians, heirs to a long history of Germanic cultural tradition, expanded from their homes to interact with the Christianized peoples of Western Europe.

This means that in order to understand the story of the Viking Age, we need to move past out easy stereotypes of blond-haired, wild-bearded, blood-thirsty barbarians and examine who the 'Vikings' truly were. That is the goal of this podcast, and I hope you are excited as I am to dive into this idea.

Anyway, I'll stop blabbering on, all this and more is discussed in the first episode, which you can listen to right below! Please don't hesitate to get in touch via the social buttons above, or the comment box below. Happy Listening.
