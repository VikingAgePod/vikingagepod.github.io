## Christ Comes to Iceland

In this episode we explore the early history of Christianity in Iceland. Along the way we talk about kings, prophets, prominent Christian settlers, and missionary methods employed in the Early Middle Ages. Finally we will introduce Thangbrand - the mildly-homicidal missionary sent to Iceland by the Norwegian King Olaf Tryggvason.

I do hope you enjoy.

### Recommended Reading 

This week's recommended reading is [Power and Conversion](http://www.academia.edu/211049/Power_and_Conversion._A_Comparative_Study_of_Christianization_in_Scandinavia) by Alexandra Sanmark. In this excellent book Professor Sanmark provides a detailed, readable and fascinating account of the conversion of Scandinavia. Even more interestingly, she also explores the similarities and differences between the Scandinavian conversions and those of Anglo Saxon England and Saxony. Plus - Professor Sanmark has provided a PDF of this excellent work for free online!
