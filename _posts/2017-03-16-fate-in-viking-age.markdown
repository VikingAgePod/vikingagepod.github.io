Fate in the Viking Age - Viking Worlds III

In this episode we talk about the role of fate in the minds of Viking Age Scandinavians. 

We will talk about Ragnarok, Individual Destiny and the dictators of fate themselves, the Norns. Then we'll conclude the episode by talking about the relationship between Fate, honor and reputation.
