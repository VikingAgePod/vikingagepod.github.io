## Mother of Kings IV - A Woman of Great Dignity

In this episode, we continue to discuss the life and legend of Gunnhild _konungamóðir_, tracing her path from Norway to Northern England and finally Denmark as she was repeated transformed from Royal to Refugee and back again.

Along the way we encounter and discuss shapeshifters, scorn poles, unruly noblemen and treacherous kings. To wrap things up, we explore the presence and influence of households headed by independent woman in the Norse world, studying the life of Auð the Deepminded and seeing what runestones have to tell us about powerful woman in the Viking Age.
