## Eastern Way III - Catastrophe and Opportunity

The 6th Century was a period of unrest and reorganization throughout Scandinavia. In this episode we are going to explore the evidence we have for these dynamic years and what may have caused this unrest. Ultimately, we want to discover how this era may have led to the establishment of powerful ruling dynasties like those who constructed Gamla Uppsala.

Along the way we'll talk about the sun going dark, explore the benefits of burying your wealth and the discuss the possible origins of a truly monstrous winter.

I hope you enjoy.
